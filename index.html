        <p>
            Hello everyone,
            I am a 22-year-old guy with a long-standing passion for computers and technology.
            I am seeking to embark on a new path in this field as I am tired of my current job
            and do not see a happy future in it. I particularly enjoy working in teams, listening
            to my peers' opinions, and exchanging ideas and perspectives with them. This course
            represents a long-term investment in my personal growth, and I am aware that in 5 years,
            I may change direction. However, at the moment, I am very enthusiastic and excited,
            so I will always give my utmost effort..
        </p>
